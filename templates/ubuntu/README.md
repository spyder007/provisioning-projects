# Provisioning Scripts - Hyper-V - Ubuntu Full

This folder contains various templates used to provision machines using the Packer `hyperv-iso` provider.  This means the templates provision a machine by downloading the ISO and provisioning the VM from scratch.  Please refer to the [Quick Provisioners](../ubuntu-quick/) for provisioning from a base image.
