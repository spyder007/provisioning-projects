# Provisioning Scripts - Hyper-V - Ubuntu Quick

This folder contains various templates used to provision machines using the Packer `hyperv-vmcx` provider.  This means the templates provision a machine by copying an existing VMCX and adding to that image.  Please refer to the [Full Provisioners](../ubuntu/) for provisioning from an ISO, and [Base Provisioner](../ubuntu-base/) for provisioning a base image.
